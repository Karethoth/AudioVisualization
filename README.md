**Audio Visualization** is an early-stage exploration of an audio-reactive overlay intended for streaming software such as OBS. The project currently acts as a sandbox for planning and prototyping ideas captured in `TODO.md`

The repository contains a minimal Avalonia shell, an audio input abstraction, and supporting notes that will evolve as the design solidifies. Expect incomplete, work-in-progress code rather than a finished product.

## Getting Started

```powershell
